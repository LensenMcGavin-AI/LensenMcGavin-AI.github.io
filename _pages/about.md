      Chris is a digital and technology policy professional with extensive experience working on AI ethics, regulation and policy. He holds a Master’s degree in law, where his thesis studied AI regulation in the context of AI harms and global regulatory instruments.<span class="dots">..</span>
      <span class="more hidden">
         Chris has considerable expertise across a variety of global AI policy efforts, such as EU’s AI Act as well as Aotearoa’s own AI policy environment. He previously worked at the Brainbox Institute, Aotearoa’s leading digital policy think-tank where he contributed to and led a number of complex projects including an extensive examination of Aotearoa’s AI landscape for the Global Index on Responsible AI, development of Aotearoa’s first comprehensive AI policy tracker, and crucial work on the Transparency Initiatives Portal in conjunction with the Action Coalition on Meaningful Transparency and Christchurch Call. His commentary on AI has been published in leading publications such as the National Business Review. Chris is a visiting scholar at Victoria University of Wellington’s Computer Science and Engineering Department where his research is focused on AI regulation, policy and ethics. He is open to research partnerships across a number of disciplines. Chris is deeply enthusiastic about ensuring that Aotearoa learns from, instead of repeating, errors made in AI implementation in other jurisdictions.
